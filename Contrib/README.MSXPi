Using MSXPi Extension for openMSX
=================================
MSXPi is a hardware and software solution that allows MSX 
computers to control and use Raspberry Pi resources. The interface
exposes I/O ports for the MSX computer, which allows exchange of 
data with the Raspberry Pi using a custom protocol. Many resources are
implemented, such as access to network drives, internet, disk images,
and access to the Raspberry Pi itself to execute commands.

The MSXPiDevice for openMSX implements the same functionality of the
physical MSXPi without the need of a Raspberry Pi - instead, relies 
on a Python msxpi-server code running on the same computer where 
openMSX is hosted.

For detailed information about the MSXPi project and the hardware interface,
go to: https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi

This README is for the openMSX extension that reproduces the behaviour of
the physical interface.

Architecture of the physical Interface:
┌────────────┐         ┌────────────────────────┐         ┌────────────────────┐
│    MSX     │  <--->  │     MSXPi Interface    │  <--->  │   msxpi-server     │
│ (Z80 I/O)  │   0x56  │   (CPLD + SPI bridge)  │  GPIO   │ (Python GPIO API)  │
└────────────┘   0x5A  └────────────────────────┘         └────────────────────┘

Now that you know everything you need (not really!) to start with MSXPi, prepare
the environment.

To use this extension, you will need Python3 installed in your computer.
IDLE will work with MSXPi in Windows - it can be downloaded and installed
from Microsoft App store. MSXPi will also work in other platforms - it
works better on Linux, since it is the native environment it was designed
for initially.
At this time, some commands will work on Windows, many won't - but they
are being ported and pushed to MSXPi repository, so I recommend to keep
refreshing your local copy frequently.

There are a lot of Python modules that are not standard in Python, and will
require you to install before running MSXPi. When you run msxpi-server, it
will complain about missing modules - use that information to install them.
For example, to install module "fs":

Go to Windows command line and type:

   python -m pip install fs

Repeat for all modules that are not already installed.

Some commands (such as ploadr) will try to use 7-Zip, LHA or UNAR to 
decompress files.. You will need to install those tools also or the
command will fail.

You will also have to download several files needed by MSXPi - follow the 
instructions below to get started.

Steps to Setup and Try MSXPi in openMSX
=======================================

1. Install an openMSX version that has support for MSXPi extension. You can download
   binaries for all platforms (nightly builds from openMSX) in the releases section:
   https://github.com/costarc/openMSX/releases
   
   Always use the latest release.
   
2. Download msxpi-server.py (the server component that runs in Python) from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/Server/Python/src
   
   Run from IDLE console, or from command line:
   
   python msxpi-server.py
   
3. Download msxpibios.rom from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/openMSX/share/systemroms/extensions
   
   Copy to you openMSX/share/systemroms/extensions/ folder.
   
4. Download the matching MSXPi.xml from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/openMSX/share/extensions
   
   copy to you openMSX/share/extensions/ folder.

5. Use a DIR as DISK with openMSX to facilitate the tests.
   Create a directory named FloppyA
   Copy MSXDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM to FloppyA
   Make sure openMSX can boot into MSX-DOS using this folder as a drive:
   
   openmsx -machine Panasonic_FS-A1WSX -diska FloppyA
   
6. Dowload the MSXPi commands you want to test from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/target
   
   Some commands will not work (yet) with openMSX because they were originally 
   developed to work on Raspberry Pi. In time, most (if not all) commands
   will be ported to abstract the platform and run everywhere. If you can develop
   in python, help port them (thanks).
   
   For now, I suggest you start with:
   
   chatgpt.com (you will need an OpenAI to use it)
   prun.com
   pcd.com
   pdir.com
   pver.com
   pset.com
   ploadr
   
   Copy all these commands to you FloppyA
 
7. Start openMSX loading the MSXPi extension:

   openmsx -machine Panasonic_FS-A1WSX -diska FloppyA -ext MSXPi
   
8. Try some commands - type exactly as shown:

   pver
   pcd
   pdir
   pcd /
   pdir
   pset
   pcd R1:
   pcd
   pcd R2:
   prun ipconfig
   prun dir /
   chatgpt
   chatgpt Tell me funny fact about MSX Computers.
   ploadr /z zaxxon.lzh
   
   Note 1: Read the Users guide to learn more about these commands. it can be 
   download here: https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/documents
   
   Note 2: As I mentioned before, some commands will not behave nicely
   because they were developed for Raspberry Pi (Linux). 
   Some work is needed on the msxpi-server side to make the commands
   work on Python running on a host that is not Linux.

9. Create a local /home/pi/msxpi/msxpi.ini
   This file is used to persist some MSXPi configuration. Create this
   folder in your computer (under Windows the path is C:\home\pi\msxpi)
   and save this file inside it:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/Server/Shell/msxpi.ini
   
   If you have an OpenAI key, update this file with it so you can use the
   chatgpt.com command.

10. Read the MSXPi documentation for more detailed information:
