<!-- Note that actually this device has a non-standard 60-pin female connector,
incompatible with the MSX cartridge slot, but suitable for the side slot of the
Yamaha CX5M series. However, a separate Yamaha UCN-01 Unit Connector can be
bought which makes it possible to connect this device to any MSX. The unit is
nothing more than a rewiring of the same signals to a standard cartridge slot
connector. In openMSX we do not model these different slot connectors, so
consider this device to have built in the Unit Connector. -->
