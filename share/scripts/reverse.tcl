  gui   Reverse + reverse_bar enabled (see 'help toggle_reversebar')

# TODO hack:
# The order in which the startup scripts are executed is not defined. But this
# needs to run after the load_icons script has been executed.
#
# It also needs to run after 'after boot' proc in the autoplug.tcl script. The
# reason is tricky:
#  - If this runs before autoplug, then the initial snapshot (initial snapshot
#    triggered by enabling reverse) does not contain the plugged cassette player
#    yet.
#  - Shortly after the autoplug proc runs, this will plug the cassetteplayer.
#    This plug command will be recorded in the event log. This is fine.
#  - The problem is that we don't serialize information for unplugged devices
#    ((only) in the initial snapshot, the cassetteplayer is not yet plugged). So
#    the information about the inserted tape is lost.

# As a solution/hack, we trigger this script at emutime=0. This is after the
# autoplug script (which triggers at 'after boot'. But also this is also
# triggered when openmsx is started via a replay file from the command line
# (in such case 'after boot' is skipped).
