  Machine has a built-in datarecorder, which is not emulated as such. The
  built-in firmware seems to have commands to control the datarecorder, which
  are also not emulated.

  Thanks to BiFi we know something about how the datarecorder is controlled:
  - control via I/O port 0x94, with the following bit map:
    bit 7 = Fast Forward
    bit 6 = Rewind
    bit 5 = Record
    bit 4 = Stop
    bit 3 = Pause
    bit 2 = Play
    bit 1 = Scan
    bit 0 = Mute
  - Scan is done in combination with Fast Forward, Rewind or Record. It's used
    to scan for the next, previous or blank spot on the cassette respectively.
  - Scan in combination with Play is the _IDTRACE command
  - Scan in combination with Pause is the _STDBY command
  - The scanning stuff is implemented in hardware
  - The commands as mentioned in the Cassette Operation Guide:
    _CFILES:   not sure, probably a scan of the whole tape
    _REC:      only bit 5 and 3 on 1 ("ready to record")
    _PLAY:     only bit 2 on 1
    _REW:      only bit 6 on 1
    _FF:       only bit 7 on 1
    _STOP:     only bit 4 on 1
    _PAUSE:    only bit 3 on 1
    _NSCAN:    only bit 1 and 7 on 1: Next SCAN
    _CSCAN:    only bit 1 and 6 on 1: C(urrent)? SCAN
    _IDTRACE:  only bit 1 and 2 on 1
    _BLSCAN:   only bit 1 and 5 on 1: BLank SCAN
    _STDBY:    only bit 1 and 3 on 1: stand by (?)
    _AUTOMUTE: ??? mutes and unmutes depending on bits read from port 0x94
    _MUTE:     only bit 0 on 1

  The speed-control button/option is also not emulated.
