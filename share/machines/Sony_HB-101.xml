      Info based on Werner Kai's red Sony HB-101 with serial 207174.

      There are 2 models of the HB-101. Werner's is of the first kind:
      - does not have springs in the transportation handle, which mean that the
        handle can be left extended. 
      - does not have gate arrays cX chips
      - does not have pull ups on the bus
      So all these things were added in the 2nd model:
      - has 2 sprints in the transportation handle so that it cannot be left extended
      - has 2 Sony CXxxx gate arrays in the PCB, same as used in HB-F5
      - has pull-ups, so that e.g. PEEK(&H8000) gives 255.

      Machines of the second model seem to have the same ROMs: the ROMs of a
      white HB-101 with SN 237929 were the same as the red one on which this
      config was based.

As there's only a 16kB and a 32kB mask ROM on the PCB, it must really be a 16kB ROM. Moreover, we found out that all unconnected memory showed as 0x7E (but unconnected I/O ports showed 0xFF) The latter is probably due to the fact that this dump was based on a machine of the first model, see above.  -->
