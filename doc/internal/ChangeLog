We don't maintain a traditional ChangeLog file anymore. Instead we try to write
detailed (git) commit messages. If you have a clone of the openMSX git
repository, you can see the commit messages with the command:
    git log

Historically we did maintain a ChangeLog file:
pre-2009:  Change entries are stored in the ChangeLog file (now renamed to
           ChangeLog.old).
2009:      Transition period. We switched from ChangeLog to commit messages.
           Unfortunately not all developers switched at the same time :(
post-2009: All change entries are written as commit messages.
