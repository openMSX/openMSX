<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1 New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/manual/">http://openmsx.org/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use this URL to get up-to-date versions of the hyperlinks
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2 Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This guide is about openMSX, the open source MSX emulator that tries to achieve
near-perfect emulation by using a novel emulation model.
You can find more information about openMSX on the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/">openMSX home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to use openMSX, there is likely <a class="external" href="faq.html#easyinstall">a pre-packaged version</a> you can use. This document describes how you can compile openMSX from source, which is useful if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is not yet a pre-packaged version for your favourite platform.</li>
<li>You want to closely follow the latest developments.</li>
<li>You want to make changes to openMSX.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you need help compiling openMSX, please
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact us</a>.
If you needed any modifications to make openMSX compile,
please send those modifications to us,
so we can make openMSX ever more portable.
</p>

<h3><a id="history">1.4 Revision History</a></h3>

<p>
For the revision history, please refer to the <a class="external"

</p>

<h2><a id="preparation">2. Preparation</a></h2>

<p>
Before you can start compiling openMSX, you have to make sure your system
has all the necessary build tools installed, as well as the libraries
openMSX depends upon. The following sections tell you how you can prepare your system.
</p>
<p>
Every section starts with generic instructions, that apply to all platforms and
compilers. At the end of each section, platform specific notes cover differences or additional steps for certain platforms
or compilers.
</p>

<h3><a id="tools">2.1 Build Tools</a></h3>

<p>
For compilation, you need <a class="external" href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a>, a C++ compiler, and some compiler-specific programs.
If you have compiled packages from source before, you probably have some of these installed already.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a></dt>
<dd>A compact and dynamic programming language. Version 2.6 or later is
required. However, Python 3.0 contains incompatible changes in the language, so
make sure you install a version from the 2.x series. Eventually Python will
replace Make completely in our build system, but at the moment both are
required. Note: on Windows 7 you may have to add the path to Python (e.g. <code>C:\Python26</code>) to your <code>PATH</code> manually.</dd>
<dt>There are three compilers that are supported to build openMSX: GCC, clang
and Visual C++. The GCC compiler builds openMSX on all supported platforms, clang is the default on Mac OS X, while Visual C++ is the primary compiler for Windows.</dt>

</dl>

<h4>GCC</h4>

<p>For compilation with GCC, you need GNU Make and g++:</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>GNU implementation of the Make tool.
Make interprets rules that define how a project should be built.
Version 3.79 or higher should suffice, but 3.80 or higher is recommended and even necessary if you are building a standalone binary with the method described below.</dd>

<dt>g++</dt>
<dd>The GNU C++ compiler.
Version 4.7 or later is required to build openMSX.
</dd>

</dl>

<h5>Microsoft Windows (MinGW)</h5>

<p>You need to install MinGW (with MSYS).</p>

<p>You can download the latest version of <code>mingw-get-inst</code> from <a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">the download page</a> of the MinGW project (it's the default download if you're on Windows). Double click on this installer after downloading. Click Next, Next, select "Download latest repository catalogues" and click Next again. Accept the license agreement and click Next. Use the default installation directory (<code>C:\MinGW</code>), or at least a <strong>clean and empty</strong> (e.g. non-existing) directory without spaces and <strong>not</strong> a network folder (i.e. shared folder on another computer) and click Next. Click Next again. In the "Select Components" step, make sure to check "C++ Compiler" and "MSYS Basic System" and click Next. Then click Install. This will then update the package repositories first, which takes a while. After this, it will download all the MinGW packages and install them.
</p>

<h5>Dingux</h5>

<p>For compilation for Dingux (Linux for Dingoo), you need to install the
OpenDingux toolchain. This toolchain is for x86
Linux; if you have an x86 machine but no Linux, you can install Linux in a
virtual machine. Extract the toolchain to <code>/opt</code>; anywhere else
won't work. It can be downloaded from the <a class="external"
href="http://www.treewalker.org/opendingux/">OpenDingux Releases</a> page.
</p>

<h4>clang</h4>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
Install Xcode from Apple, which you can find in the Mac App Store. Start Xcode and from the menu select Xcode &gt; Preferences... &gt; Downloads and install the "Command Line Tools" component. The openMSX build is not done inside the Xcode IDE, but it uses the SDK and command line tools that are provided by Xcode.
</p>

<h4>Visual C++</h4>

<p>To build with Visual C++ you need to have the latest version of it installed. Currently, this is 2013 update 3.</p>

<p>There are three different ways to obtain the Visual C++ compiler:</p>
<dl>

<dt>
<a class="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Visual Studio</a></dt>
<dd>This is the professional IDE and development environment that comes with Visual Studio, as a standalone
purchase or via an MSDN subscription.</dd>

	<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop">Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop</a></dt>
	<dd>This is a free (as in beer) IDE and development environment. It builds 32 and 64-bit binaries out of the box. Make sure you download the latest version. </dd>
	<dt>If you require the resulting binaries to run on Windows XP, the <a class="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx">DirectX SDK</a>
	is required. To generate an MSI installation package,
	<a class="external" href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX</a> package must
	be installed.</dt>

</dl>

<dl>

<dt>
<a class="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx">DirectX SDK</a></dt>
<dd>This is the SDK that contains DirectX headers, libs, samples, documentation,
etc. We recommend using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271274">
June 2010</a> version. This is a large download, about 580MB. To build
openMSX, only the headers and libs are truly required. Download only when you want the resulting binaries to run on Windows XP as well.</dd>

<dt> <a class="external" href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX</a></dt>
<dd>This is a tool that generates MSI installer packages. We recommend using
version 3.0 or later. If you see a message that the &quot;Votive&quot; component won't install, that's not
a problem, just continue.</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Android</h4>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the build of the Android version is only supported on a Linux or Unix host platform. If you want
to build the Android version on a Windows host, then you must install a virtual machine with a Linux distribution on it. This is because the Android build depends on the "commandergenius" SDL Android port, which can only be build on Linux and Unix platforms.</p>

<p>The Android build depends on the following toolkits and libraries that must first be installed:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The Android SDK</dt>
	<dd>Download the Android SDK from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK site</a>. It is sufficient to download
    the SDK Tools only package; For openMSX you do not need the so-called ADT bundle. The current SDK Tools only package is
    <a class="external" href="http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r23.0.2-linux.tgz">Android SDK R23.0.2 Linux</a>.
	After downloading it, unpack it to your favourite location and add following Android SDK directories to your PATH environment
	variable: <code>${ANDROID_SDK}/tools:${ANDROID_SDK}/platform-tools:${ANDROID_SDK}/build-tools/${ANDROID_SDK_VERSION}</code>.
	It is advisable to do this in your <code>~/.profile</code>
	script so that the setting remains available on each login. Note that <code>${ANDROID_SDK}</code> stands for the
	directory in which you installed the Android SDK, for example <code>/opt/android/android-sdk-linux</code> 
	and <code>${ANDROID_SDK_VERSION}</code> stands for the version of the SDK, for example <code>20.0.0</code>.
	See the README in the ${ANDROID-SDK} directory for further instructions on how to download extra tools and libraries.</dd>
	<dt>The Android NDK</dt>
	<dd>Download the Android NDK from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK site</a>,
	unpack it to your favourite location and add the following Android NDK directory to your PATH environment
	variable: <code>${ANDROID_NDK_HOME}</code>. It is advisable to do this in your <code>~/.profile</code>
	script so that the setting remains available on each login. Note that <code>${ANDROID_NDK_HOME}</code> stands for the
	directory in which you installed the Android NDK, for example <code>/opt/android/android-ndk-r9c</code>.</dd>
	<dt>The "commandergenius" SDL Android port</dt>
	<dd>Download the SDL Android port from the git repository to your favourite location. You can download it
	into the current directory with the following command: <code>git clone https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius.git</code>. Once that is done, you must set-up an environment variable called SDL_ANDROID_PORT_PATH with the location
	of the SDL android port. For example <code>/opt/android/commandergenius</code></dd>
	<dt>Java Development Kit</dt>
	<dd>Make sure you install the JDK from your distro. Example packages: <code>openjdk-6-jdk</code> (Debian Wheezy), <code>java-1.7.0-openjdk</code> (SuSE 12.2).</dd>
	<dt>Ant</dt>
	<dd>Make sure you install Ant build tool from your distro. Example packages: <code>ant</code> (Debian Squeeze/6.0), <code>ant-1.8.2-11.1.1.noarch</code> (SuSE 12.2).</dd>
	<dt>Ant-optional</dt>
	<dd>Make sure you install Ant-optional extensions from your distro. Example packages: <code>ant-optional</code> (Debian Squeeze/6.0). Note that this seems to be not applicable for SuSE 12.2; apparently everything is bundled in the ant package.</dd>
	<dt>zip</dt>
	<dd>Make sure you install the zip command line tool from your distro. Example packages: <code>zip</code> (Debian Squeeze/6.0), <code>zip</code> (SuSE 12.2).</dd>
	<dt>libz 32-bit</dt>
	<dd>Make sure that if you have a 64-bit distro, you (also) install the 32-bit version of libz (it is required by the Android NDK). Example packages: <code>lib32z1</code> (Debian Squeeze/6.0), <code>zlib-32bit</code> (SuSE 12.2).</dd>
	<dt>libstdc++6 32-bit</dt>
	<dd>Make sure that if you have a 64-bit distro, you (also) install the 32-bit version of libstdc++6 (it is required by the Android NDK). Example packages: <code>lib32stdc++6</code> (Debian Squeeze/6.0), <code>libstdc++47-32bit</code> (SuSE 12.2).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
After you installed the Android SDK, you actually only installed the "Android SDK Manager". You'll have to use this manager to install the proper Android SDK packages. Start up this tool by running <code>android</code> in a terminal (you added it to your PATH in the previous step). This should open a new window. You should first get some messages in the status bar that it is fetching the repositories. After that, you should get a list of all possible SDK API versions. If you get errors like <code>HttpHostConnect Connection to http://dl-ssl.google.com refused</code>, you are hitting this bug: <a class="external" href="http://skybert.net/java/ipv46-related-network-problems/">IPv4/6 Related Network Problems</a>. You'll have to solve this to proceed.
</p>
<p>Once you have the list of packages, you must select the following options for installation:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Tools -&gt; Android SDK Platform-tools
		<ul>
			<li>Android 4.4 (API 19) -&gt; SDK platform</li>
			<li>Android 2.3.3 (API 10) -&gt; SDK Platform</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be possible that by default another version of the Android API is pre-selected. You may unselect it in order to save download time and diskspace. (You also don't need the Android Support Package, so if it gets selected, you can also unselect that one.) Next step is to click the "Install N packages" button (N seems to vary a bit... it may be like 12) to install the packages (accept the license terms). After downloading and installing, you can close the Android SDK Manager.</p>

<h3><a id="libs">2.2 Libraries</a></h3>

<p>
openMSX depends on the following libraries:
</p>
<dl>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a></dt>
<dd>Simple DirectMedia Layer, a cross-platform library that provides low-level access to video, audio and input devices.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/">SDL_ttf</a></dt>
<dd>Library that provides support for TrueType Fonts in SDL.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</a></dt>
<dd>Library for handling PNG images.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.zlib.org/">zlib</a></dt>
<dd>Library for file compression.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a></dt>
<dd>The Tool Command Language, an embeddable scripting language. openMSX requires Tcl 8.5; older versions will not work.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> (optional)</dt>
<dd>Library for accelerated graphics. It is likely that OpenGL is already installed on your system. If not, you should probably get the OpenGL implementation from the manufacturer of your graphics card. On Linux, using <a class="external" href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa</a> with a DRI driver can be an alternative.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a> (optional)</dt>
<dd>The OpenGL Extension Wrangler, a library that greatly simplifies the use of OpenGL extensions.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/">Ogg</a> (optional)</dt>
<dd>The Laserdisc emulation expects files in the Ogg container format for the video and audio of Laserdiscs.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/">Vorbis</a> (optional)</dt>
<dd>The Laserdisc emulation expects audio encoded with Vorbis in the ogg container format for the audio of Laserdiscs. Vorbis was chosen since it is not patent-encumbered.</dd>

<dt><a class="external" href="http://www.xiph.org/theora/">Theora</a> (optional)</dt>
<dd>The Laserdisc emulation expects video encoded with the Theora codec in the ogg container format for the video of Laserdiscs. Again, Theora was chosen since it is not patent-encumbered.</dd>

</dl>

<h4>GCC / clang</h4>
<p>
You can install the required libraries systemwide, or you can use the "3rd party libraries" support in the openMSX build system and build a stand-alone binary. Systemwide is recommended if you run a modular operating system (such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X with MacPorts, Homebrew or Fink) and you intend to only use the openMSX binary on your computer. The 3rd party library system is recommended if you build for other operating systems (Windows, plain Mac OS X or embedded systems) or if you want to build a binary that can be used on other computers besides your own. If you choose the latter, please skip to the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">Stand-alone Binary</a> chapter.
</p>
<h5>Android</h5>
<p>
For Android, most of the required libraries are bundled with the SDL Android port that you downloaded
in the "Build Tools" section. The only missing library is the Tcl library. However, you don't have to do
anything special to get it. The Tcl library is automatically downloaded and compiled by the Android specific
parts of the openMSX build system. If you want to build openMSX for Android, you can immediately jump to the
<a class="internal" href="#getsource">Getting the source code</a> chapter.
</p>

<h5>Debian and Ubuntu Linux</h5>
<p>
You can easily install all required packages using the "build dependencies" feature of the APT package manager:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
sudo apt-get build-dep openmsx
</div>
<p>
Do note that if the Debian/Ubuntu package that is in the version of the distribution you are currently running is older than the openMSX version you are trying to compile (which is typically so), you might miss some dependencies that were added in the newer version. The build system will complain and you will have to install the remaining (missing) packages manually. Read on to get some tips about that.
</p>

<h5>Dingux</h5>

<p>We only support the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">Stand-alone
Binary</a> method, which means the openMSX build system will download
and compile all libraries automatically.</p>

<h5>Other Linux</h5>
<p>
Most Linux distributions have libraries split over two packages: a runtime package and a development package.
The runtime package for the "Foo" library is typically called
<code>libfoo</code>, the development package is typically named
<code>libfoo-dev</code> or <code>libfoo-devel</code>.
Applications that use a library only require the runtime package to be installed, but compilation requires both the runtime package and the development package to be installed.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
The easiest thing to do is to use the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">stand-alone binary</a> method, which will get the libraries automatically.</p>
<p>
If you want to do things manually, you can get the libraries from
<a class="external" href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>,
<a class="external" href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>
or
<a class="external" href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>. These are tools to give you access to a large collection of software packages (or ports). You can use them to install those packages (or ports). The manual approach is not regularly tested by the openMSX developers; unless you enjoy tinkering with builds we suggest you use the stand-alone binary approach instead.
</p>

<h5>Microsoft Windows (MinGW)</h5>

<p>
We strongly recommend using the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">Stand-alone
Binary</a> method, which means the openMSX build system will download and compile all libraries automatically.
</p>

<h4>Visual C++</h4>

<p>
When building with Visual C++, the optional libraries mentioned above are
arranged as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Headers and libraries for OpenGL are included with Visual C++ by default.</li>
	<li>The GLEW, Ogg, Theora and Vorbis libraries are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, when building with Visual C++, the &quot;3rd party libraries&quot; support in the openMSX
build system must be used. The resulting binary statically links in all
dependencies, including the C runtime. For more details, please see the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">
Stand-alone Binary</a> chapter.
</p>
<h2><a id="getsource">3. Getting the Source Code</a></h2>

<p>
openMSX is developed using the tools
<a class="external" href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>
freely offers to open source projects.
The code is stored in Git, an open source version management system.
Once in a while an openMSX release is made.
</p>

<p>
There are several options for getting the source code:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getrelease">Released Version</a></dt>
<dd>
These are tested versions, which should give you little problems compiling
and running.
However, as openMSX development if often quite fast, they may not have all
the latest features.
Also there could be bugs that have been fixed since the last release.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getscm">Git Clone</a></dt>
<dd>
Through Git you can get the same development version the
openMSX developers are using.
This is the bleeding edge:
the latest stuff, which may be great or may be horribly broken.
Usually the latest openMSX code compiles and runs fine, but we're only human,
so once in a while it breaks.
Also there may be changes that are not documented yet.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Releases are intended for general users, Git Clone is intended for
(would be) developers, heavy testers and people who want to follow new
developments closely. It might be a good idea to play with a release first. If
you like what you see and want to get in deeper, you can switch to a Git Clone later.
A Git Clone is very comfortable, because then you can do efficient
incremental updates, saving network bandwidth and compile time.
</p>

<p>
If you downloaded a version that is either a lot older or a lot newer than
this guide, it is a good idea to read the guide included in your downloaded
version instead of the version you're reading right now.
You can find the Compilation Guide in the directory
<code>doc/manual</code>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getrelease">3.1 Released Version</a></h3>

<p>
You can download a released version of openMSX from
<a class="external" href="https://github.com/openMSX/openMSX/releases/"
>the releases page on GitHub</a>.
The latest version is probably the best one. This guide assumes that you are using the latest release.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type the following in a UNIX or MinGW Shell (in your start menu), or use another
decompression tool:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf openmsx-VERSION.tar.gz</div>
<p>
in which <code>VERSION</code> is the openMSX version you downloaded, or use the
file name you saved the tar.gz file with. The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file
is called <em>the top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getscm">3.2 Git Clone</a></h3>

<p>
Getting a Git clone means you use Git to retrieve the latest version
of the source code of openMSX.
This means you will need to install a Git client.
This package is usually named <code>git</code>.
There are graphical front-ends for Git,
but this guide will tell you how to use Git from the command line. More information about Git can be found on the <a class="external"
href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">Git Documentation</a> site.</p>
<p>
Windows
users might want to look at <a class="external" href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">msysGit</a> for a command line tool, <a class="external" href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/">TortoiseGit</a> for Windows Explorer integration, or <a class="external" href="http://gitextensions.github.io/">Git Extensions</a>, which also includes Visual Studio integration.
</p>

<p>
With the following line (which is also displayed when you <a class="external" href="https://github.com/openMSX">browse an openMSX git repository</a>) you can retrieve the latest sources (also works on Windows when using msysGit):
</p>
<div class="commandline">
git clone https://github.com/openMSX/openMSX.git openMSX
</div>
<p>
In this line you specified where you want to retrieve the files from
(host name of the Git server),
what project you want to retrieve (<em>openMSX</em> in this case), what
module you want to get (<em>openMSX.git</em> in this case, which is the module that contains
the sources of the main openMSX program) and what directory it should be
cloned to (we chose <em>openMSX</em> in this example).
</p>

<p>
When compiling openMSX on Windows with GCC, it's often convenient to use <code>C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\&lt;username&gt;\openMSX</code>
as the target directory, as this is easy to reach from your MinGW Shell - it's
your MinGW home directory.
</p>

<p>
If you're a developer, it makes sense to use this git commandline:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
git clone git@github.com:openMSX/openMSX.git openMSX
</div>

<p>
For this to work smoothly, without having to type your password all the time, it's probably a good idea to <a class="external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#platform-all">read the GitHub docs about SSH keys</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Git command creates a directory called <code>openMSX</code> for you
in the current directory (or in the directory you specified in TortoiseGit).
This directory is what we call in this manual <em>the top
of the source tree</em>.
In addition to the openMSX code, you will see a hidden
Git administration directory called <code>.git</code>.
Do not mess with it (nor move contents of this directory around), otherwise Git will get confused.
</p>

<p>
If you want to update your source tree later,
go to the top of the source tree and type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
git pull
</div>
<p>
or right click on the openMSX directory in Windows Explorer and select "TortoiseGit -&gt; Pull...".

<h2><a id="local">4. Binary for Local System</a></h2>

<p>
This section explains how to build openMSX for a local system. If you want to build openMSX for Android, you can skip this section and use the <a class="internal" href="#androidbuild">Android build</a> method. If you want to create a binary that runs everywhere, we recommend to skip this chapter and use the <a class="internal" href="#standalone">stand-alone binary</a> method. We also recommend to do that for Mac OS X and especially for Microsoft Windows systems.
</p>

<h3><a id="compilelocal">4.1 Compilation</a></h3>

<p>
Now that all the necessary tools and libraries are installed,
you are almost ready to start the actual compilation of openMSX.
</p>

<h4>GCC</h4>

<p>
The first thing you may want to know is that you can build openMSX in
different flavours. The default flavour depends on the CPU, but is always one that is optimized for performance. For example for x86 processors the default
flavour is "i686": i.e., with optimisations for Pentium II and higher,
without any debugging stuff. Note: On an older VIA Epia (with the Samuel 2 CPU at least), a binary built with "i686" flavour will not run. Please
use the "opt" flavour for that platform.
</p>
<p>
If you are testing new openMSX developments or making changes in openMSX, you can benefit from asserts and debug symbols. To get those, you should select the "devel" flavour, like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
export OPENMSX_FLAVOUR=devel
</div>
<p>
Although the default flavours will probably be OK for most cases, you may want to write a specific flavour for your particular wishes. The flavour files are all named <code>build/flavour-*.mk</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can select the C++ compiler to be used like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
export CXX=g++-4.7
</div>
<p>
This can be useful if the default compiler on your system is an old GCC version which is either not capable of compiling openMSX, or generates less efficient code.
</p>

<p>
Now we can let a script check if you have indeed all necessary libraries and headers installed.
Go to the top of your openMSX source tree and run the following script:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
./configure
</div>
<p>
This script will report what versions of libraries you have installed.
It also reports which components can be built with those libraries.
If the script reports that it can't build the openMSX core component,
you should install the missing ones before you can continue.
Otherwise, you can decide to install the libraries needed for the optional
components, or to continue without building some components (e.g. the OpenGL based renderers).
</p>

<p>
If installing the correct libraries doesn't help,
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
If you file a bug report, please attach the <code>probe.log</code> file
that is written by the <code>configure</code> script in the directory
<code>derived/&lt;cpu&gt;-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;flavour&gt;/config/</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can customise the build process by editing the file
<code>build/custom.mk</code>.
The most likely thing you might want to customise is the installation directory (<code>INSTALL_BASE</code>).
If you are installing openMSX on a system on which you do not have
superuser (root) privileges, you can set the installation directory
to a subdirectory of your home directory.
</p>

<p>
After successfully running <code>configure</code>,
it's time to compile everything.
To start compilation, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make
</div>
<p>
Depending on how fast your system is,
this may take several minutes to half an hour.
</p>

<p>
If you get errors during compilation,
there may be something wrong that was not detected by configure.
Verify that you installed
<a class="internal" href="#libs">all required libraries</a>,
both the run time and development packages.
If that doesn't help, or we forgot to list a library openMSX depends on,
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
Make sure you provide us with the error message you got.
</p>

<h4>clang</h4>

<h5>Linux and BSD</h5>

<p>
Add <code>CXX=clang++</code> as an argument to the <code>make</code> command to select clang as the compiler instead of GCC.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
Since openMSX 0.10.0, the minimum required Mac OS X release to build openMSX out of the box is 10.7. This implies that only x86_64 CPUs (64-bit Intel) are supported.
</p>
<p>
Building for older Mac OS X releases should be possible in theory, but it requires a lot of effort to set up the compiler and SDK (C++11 support is required), adjust the openMSX build (<code>build/platform-darwin.mk</code>) etc. It's easier to try an older openMSX release instead.
</p>

<h4>Visual C++</h4>

<p>
While it is possible to configure the supplied Visual C++ project files to
dynamically link against import libraries, this is not currently supported.</p>
<h3><a id="installlocal">4.2 Installation</a></h3>

<h4>GCC / clang</h4>

<h5>Linux and BSD</h5>

<p>
To install openMSX, run the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make install
</div>
<p>
This installs openMSX, by default in <code>/opt/openMSX</code>.
Note that only root has rights to write to system-wide directories such as
<code>/opt</code>,
so you may have to do <code>su</code> before <code>make install</code>, or use <code>sudo</code>.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
On Mac OS X, the build creates an application folder. You can "install" this by copying it to a different location. The application folder will depend on systemwide installed libraries, so it will not work on Macs without those libraries.
</p>
<p>
You can run openMSX from the application folder with the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
open derived/&lt;cpu&gt;-darwin-&lt;flavour&gt;/bindist/openMSX.app
</div>
<p>
If you want to see the messages openMSX prints to stdout and stderr, start openMSX like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
derived/&lt;cpu&gt;-darwin-&lt;flavour&gt;/bindist/openMSX.app/Contents/MacOS/openmsx
</div>

<h2><a id="standalone">5. Stand-alone Binary</a></h2>

<p>
This chapter describes how to build a binary of openMSX that does not depend on any libraries except those that are available on the platform by default. This procedure is highly recommended on Microsoft Windows. It is also recommended on Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
The stand-alone binary is made by linking statically against all libraries which are not available as part of the basic platform. The build system will automatically download the sources for these libraries and build them in the minimal configuration needed by openMSX.</p>

<h3><a id="compilestandalone">5.1 Compilation</a></h3>

<h4>GCC / clang</h4>
<p>
If you want to change something about this process, for example switch to a newer library release, edit the <code>build/3rdparty.mk</code> Makefile.
</p>

<p>
Just like for normal compilation, you can set environment variables such as <code>OPENMSX_FLAVOUR</code>, <code>CXX</code>, <code>OPENMSX_TARGET_CPU</code> and <code>OPENMSX_TARGET_OS</code>.
</p>

<p>
To build a stand-alone binary, run the following command at the top of the source tree:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make staticbindist
</div>
<p>
The final output files will be produced in <code>derived/&lt;cpu&gt;-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;flavour&gt;-3rd/bindist</code>.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
The final output is a DMG file (Mac disk image) containing the openMSX application folder and documentation. This file is internet-enabled, which means it will be automatically mounted after it is downloaded.
</p>

<h5>Microsoft Windows (MinGW)</h5>

<p>
Here's the very short version if you want quick results on Microsoft Windows
with GCC:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a MinGW Shell</li>
<li>Go to the <em>top of the source tree</em> (e.g.: <code>cd openMSX</code> if you chose the MinGW home directory as target directory)</li>
<li>Type: <code>make staticbindist</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A complete package will be created in <code>derived\x86-mingw32-i686-3rd\bindist\install</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you additionally want to build an (by current developers unused) openMSX installer, you should refer to the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/openMSX/package-windows/"><code>package-windows</code></a> module in our Git repository. It contains a README file with a short manual.
</p>

<p>
Note: on a 64-bit Windows system, MinGW will pretend to have built 64-bit binaries (target directory is <code>derived\x86_64-mingw32-opt-3rd\bindist\install</code>), but they're actually just 32-bit.
</p>

<h5>Dingux</h5>

<p>After having the toolchain installed, you can simply compile openMSX with
this command:</p>
<div class="commandline">
make staticbindist OPENMSX_TARGET_CPU=mipsel OPENMSX_TARGET_OS=dingux OPENMSX_FLAVOUR=opt
</div>

<p>When this is done, you have a ready to use ZIP file for distribution in the folder <code>derived/mipsel-dingux-opt-3rd/</code>.</p>

<h4>Visual C++</h4>

<p>When building with Visual C++, the result is a static executable with minimal
dynamic library dependencies. Two platforms are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Win32</strong> - a 32-bit binary that runs on both 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows</li>
	<li><strong>x64</strong> - a native 64-bit binary that runs only on 64-bit versions of Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Three different configurations are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Debug</strong>: assertions enabled, debug prints enabled, no optimization,
	very slow</li>
	<li><strong>Developer</strong>: assertions enabled, debug prints disabled, no optimization</li>
	<li><strong>Release</strong>: assertions disabled, debug prints disabled, full optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>When building with Visual C++, you can either use the IDE or build from the command line using <code>msbuild</code>. To do the latter, you need to open a Visual Studio command prompt. A shortcut to a Visual Studio command prompt can usually be found in your start menu. For Visual Studio (Express) 2013, it will be in &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio 2013\Visual Studio Tools&quot; as the &quot;Visual Studio Command Prompt&quot;.</p>
<!-- TODO - Replace this section when we have integration with the broader 3rd party system -->
<p>In order to build openMSX, the libraries it depends on need to be
downloaded and unpacked:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open a command prompt and go to the <em>top of the openMSX source tree</em></li>
	<li>Type <code>python build\thirdparty_download.py windows</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
The following steps can then be used to build openMSX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Visual Studio command prompt</li>
	<li>Go to the <em>top of the openMSX source tree</em></li>
	<li>To build 3rd party libraries, type <code>msbuild -p:Configuration=<strong>Release</strong>;Platform=<strong>Win32</strong> build\3rdparty\3rdparty.sln</code></li>
	<li>To build openMSX, type <code>msbuild -p:Configuration=<strong>Release</strong>;Platform=<strong>Win32</strong> build\msvc\openmsx.sln</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The openMSX executable will be generated in <code>derived\Win32-VC-Release\install</code>.</p>
<p>To build for other platforms or configurations, simply replace &quot;Release&quot; and
&quot;Win32&quot;&nbsp;in the command lines above with the desired options.</p>
<p>To build using the Visual C++ IDE, simply open the aforementioned solution files and from the Build menu select &quot;Build Solution&quot;. This is exactly equivalent to building from the command line using <code>msbuild</code>.</p>
<h3><a id="installstandalone">5.2 Installation</a></h3>

<!-- TODO - generalize this for both MinGW and VC++, integrate into make install -->
<!-- TODO - ensure wxCatapult is optional -->
<h4>Visual C++</h4>
<p>
The following step creates .zip and .msi installation packages for openMSX on Windows using WiX:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Build <a href="#standalone_compilation">openMSX</a> and
	<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/catapult-manual/compile.html">wxCatapult</a>
	for a given platform (Win32 or x64) and configuration (usually Release builds)</li>
	<li>Go to the <em>top of the openMSX source tree</em></li>
	<li>Run <code>build\package-windows\package.cmd <strong>platform configuration</strong>
	<strong>catapult_source_path</strong></code>:<ul>
		<li><strong>platform</strong> is one of { Win32, x64 }</li>
		<li><strong>configuration</strong> is one of { Release, Developer, Debug }</li>
		<li><strong>catapult_source_path</strong> is the path to the wxCatapult directory</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>An example command line would be (for 64 bit):</p>
<div class="commandline">
	build\package-windows\package.cmd x64 Release ..\wxCatapult</div>

<p>The resulting package files can be found in <code>derived\x64-VC-Release\package-windows.</code></p>

<h4>Dingux</h4>

<p>From the ZIP created in the previous step (or downloaded from the openMSX
download site), copy the directory named <code>local</code> to the root of the
Dingux miniSD card. If you have run Dingux from the miniSD card before, there
will already be a directory named <code>local</code>. You can safely merge both
directories.
</p>

<p>
To get it in your own menu, you'll have to add the openMSX entry to it
yourself. Use the start up script <code>openmsx-start.sh</code> for this, which
is installed in <code>local/bin</code>. Even without the menu, you
will have to use this script to start openMSX, it won't work otherwise.
</p>

<h2><a id="androidbuild">6. Android build</a></h2>

<p>
This chapter describes how to build an Android APK package of openMSX for Android and install it
on an Android device.
</p>
<h3><a id="androidbuildintegrate">Integrate SDL Android build with openMSX build</a></h3>

<p>Once you have downloaded the openMSX source (see
<a class="internal" href="#getsource">Getting the Source Code</a> chapter) and the toolkits and libraries
(see <a class="internal" href="#preparation">Preparation</a> chapter), you must integrate the openMSX build
system with the SDL Android port build system.</p>
<p>Basically, the build will be driven by the build system of the SDL Android port and
you must set that one up in order to be able to build openMSX. In order to do that, you must execute the following
commands, whereby <code>OPENMSX_SRC_HOME</code> stands for the directory into which the openMSX source has been loaded:</p>
<div class="commandline">
<pre>
	cd $OPENMSX_SRC_HOME/build/android
	./setup_anddev.sh
</pre>
</div>

<h3><a id="androidcompilationandinstallation">Compilation and installation</a></h3>

<h4>Build of the Android version</h4>
<p>
In order to build the Android version, you must enter the following commands:</p>
<div class="commandline">
<pre>
	cd $OPENMSX_SRC_HOME/build/android/openmsx
	./launch_anddev_build.sh
</pre>
</div>

<p>If this gives an error like "Unable to find a javac compiler; com.sun.tools.javac.Main is not on the classpath. Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK.", you may have to set the environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> manually. E.g. if <code>javac</code> is actually installed in <code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/bin</code>, make sure to <code>export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64</code> before running this command.</p>

<h4>(Re-)installation of the Android version</h4>
<p>
In order to install the Android version, you must connect the Android device with a USB cable to
the computer, enable the "Developer options" in the settings menu and within the "Developers options" enable
the "USB debugging" option. Once that is done, you can install the APK that was build in the
previous step with the following commands:</p>
<div class="commandline">
<pre>
	cd $SDL_ANDROID_PORT_PATH
	adb install -r project/bin/MainActivity-debug.apk
</pre>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, you can put this file on a place where you can access it with your device (e.g. on a webserver or sending an e-mail). Then you can download and install it like any APK file.</p>

<h4>Build and (re-)installation of the Android version in one step</h4>
<p>
In order to build and directly install the Android version, you must enter the following commands:</p>
<div class="commandline">
<pre>
	cd $OPENMSX_SRC_HOME/build/android/openmsx
	./launch_anddev_build.sh -i
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that this only works when the "Developer options" -&gt; "USB debugging" setting has been enabled
on the Android device.</p>


<h2><a id="next">7. Next Steps</a></h2>

<p>
If all went well, you should have openMSX installed now or have a stand alone working binary.
You can test it by executing openMSX from the command line:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
openmsx
</div>

<p>
or, by tapping (on Android) or double clicking (on other systems) the openMSX executable or icon that resulted
from the previous step.
</p>

<p>
You should get a screen similar to this:
</p>
<div class="commandline"><pre>
C-BIOS 0.25        cbios.sf.net

No cartridge found.

This version of C-BIOS can
only start cartridges.
Please restart your MSX
(emulator) with a cartridge
inserted.
</pre></div>

<p>
C-BIOS MSX2+ is the default system BIOS used by openMSX.
It was written from scratch by BouKiCHi and he was kind enough to let us
distribute it together with openMSX.
It is not perfect yet, but it runs many ROM games well.
Nowadays C-BIOS is a separate (SourceForge.net) project, with its own <a class="external" href="http://cbios.sourceforge.net/">web page</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a ROM image ready, you can try to run it with C-BIOS:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
openmsx ~/msx/games/my-favourite-game.rom
</div>

<p>
or, you can just drop it on the openMSX executable.
</p>

<p>
The next step would be to read the
<a class="external" href="setup.html">openMSX Setup Guide</a>.
That document describes how you can configure openMSX to emulate
actual MSX machines, such as the Panasonic FS-A1GT (turboR).
It also describes how you can have openMSX start up with your
personal settings, how you can configure openMSX and your system
for optimal performance and several other configuration related
topics.
And finally there is of course the
<a class="external" href="user.html">openMSX User's Manual</a>,
which describes all the things you can do with openMSX once
it is fully running.
</p>

<p>
If you got stuck somewhere in the compilation and installation process,
please contact us. The next chapter will tell you how.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>

<p>
You can run the openMSX application folder from Finder or from the command line:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
open derived/&lt;cpu&gt;-darwin-&lt;flavour&gt;-3rd/bindist/openMSX.app
</div>

<p>
We do not have a finished GUI yet that works on Mac OS X, so you can either use openMSX from the command line for now, or use third party software like <a class="external" href="http://nekocan.sitemix.jp/?page_id=17">NekoLauncher openMSX</a>.
</p>

<h5>Microsoft Windows</h5>

<p>
You can use the <a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/catapult-manual/">
Catapult</a> launcher to run openMSX.</p>

<h4>GCC / clang</h4><p>For experienced users: if you get a crash or a hang,
try to provide a <code>gdb</code> backtrace.
This will only work if you did not strip the openMSX binary
of its debug symbols.</p>

<p>Another useful thing to do is to install the debug versions of libstdc++ and libc6,
and then run openmsx with an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug</code> exported in the environment.
This will give a more detailed stacktrace, especially in optimized code.
</p>

<h4>Visual C++</h4><p>For experienced users: if you get a crash or a hang,
try to provide a user dump. This will work for any openMSX binary, including
pre-built binaries obtained from <a class="external" href="http://openmsx.org/">openmsx.org</a>.</p>
<p>As of Windows Vista SP1 and later operating systems, you can find user dump files for crashed processes
in the &quot;%LocalAppData%\CrashDumps&quot; directory. The default Windows crash dump
behavior can be further customized as per
