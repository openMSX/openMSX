Release Notes for openMSX 0.15.0 (2018-11-xx)
=============================================

Again a release, because we did quite a lot, so it's due! Major new stuff is
support for ColecoVision (including Super Game Module and MegaCart mapper),
Musical Memory Mapper and Carnivore 2. And we have fixed a lot of long-standing
OPL4 emulation issues, thanks to Valley Bell. Furthermore, we overhauled the
Android port, but you'll mostly notice the scale factor 2 there. And several
other (sometimes very long standing) issues were fixed.

Here's the list with all highlights and details:

MSX device support:
- fixed 16 year old bug regarding sprites behaviour as shown in Ash Guine 3

- fixed V9958 commands in non-bitmap modes
- allow non-standard cartridge slots to be used as normal cartridge slots,
  consistently

- fixed a bug in the turboR mapper
- fixed a bug regarding VIBrato in the YM2413 (Okazaki core)
- fixed CAPS lock on SVI 318/328

  ColecoVision games (mostly MSX ports)
- added emulation of the Carnivore 2 cartridge
- improved emulation of OPL4 (wave part) considerably, thanks to Valley Bell
- added emulation of bizarre I/O port mirroring of Philips Music Module (thanks
  to Grauw and L. Oliveira for doing the research)
- implemented Y8910 status register bit 0
- fixed exact formula for noise generation on AY8910 (PSG)
- made memory mapper ports readable on MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD, conforming to the
  latest version of this cartridge

  Dragon MSX (thanks to MAME), Yamaha CX7/128 and CX7M/128 (thanks to Peter
  Hanraets), Al Alamiah Sakhr AX230, Sanyo MPC-2, Yamaha CX11 (thanks to
  Tabajara Labs) and Toshiba HX-32 (thanks to Jorge Janaite Neto)
- added new extensions: Musical Memory Mapper, Carnivore 2 and SN76489 (on the
  same I/O port as PlaySoniq)

New or improved emulator features:
- fixed some crashes when using very high Z80 frequencies
- improved tab-completion to initially hide internal procs, until you specify
  the namespace
- many updates to the software database
- improved the VGM recorder script: record sample RAM content before logging
- changed default machine symlinks to JP machines (for applicable systems)
- many robustness fixes against bad XML config files
- added videosource setting to OSD menu, GFX9000 is getting more popular
- fixed reverse bug in GFX9000
- performance improvements: several fixes to improve start-up time
- added support for DCSG in the music keyboard and vu meters script
- changed events about unplugging to an empty plug-event
- changed fixed scale factor from 1 to 2 on Android
- added OSD menu button to open the main menu for Android, as (most?) modern
  Android devices do not have a menu button anymore
- OSD menu: fixed issue of getting stuck in an unreadable directory when
  browsing for a file (e.g. on Android)
- added scrollbar when showing lists in OSD menu, as a visual cue on the length
  of a list; the scrollbar cannot be dragged
- fixed crash in hq/hqlite scalers in interlace modes
- fixed frame skipping when doing 'debug continue'
- fixed function keys not working anymore when console is open on macOS
- exposed tile viewer widget to the console (try "about tile")

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- upgraded C-BIOS to release 0.29a: default to 60Hz generic international
  config
- put several pieces of code under unit-test with the Catch2 framework
- added svicpm2dmk utility so disk images from the web can be converted to a
  suitable DMK file for use with the SVI-707 drive with CP/M ROM
- reworked complete Android port build. Now uses NDK 18b and recent version of
  commandergenius Android SDL port and all other 3rd party libraries are built
  by the openMSX build system. Minimum required Android version is now 4.1.
- removed all hand-made ARM and 32-bit x86 assembly code
- fixed version information of application on macOS
- added workaround for FreeType no longer installing its config script

And of course the usual various bug fixes and performance improvements.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
