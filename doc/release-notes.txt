  Mr. Takeda's Common Source Code Project
- added emulation of BeerIDE (experimental)
- added many new machines: Canon V-25 (thanks to Rudi Westerhof), Canon V-8,
  Fenner/Samsung SPC-800, Hitachi MB-H1, Toshiba HX-10D (thanks to Ricardo
  Jurcyk Pinheiro), Canon V-10, Canon V-20 (JP), Spectravideo SVI-728 (ES),
  Mitsubishi ML-TS2 (partly, it's still work-in-progress), Sony HB-101 (JP),
  Sony HB-201 (JP), Sanyo MPC-6, Mitsubishi ML-F120 and ML-F110 and Hitachi
  MB-H3 (thanks to Werner Kai) and Yamaha AX350IIF (thanks to Rudolf Gutlich)

New or improved emulator features:
- added "too_fast_vram_access_callback": you can now run a Tcl script when the
  running MSX software accesses VRAM too fast, e.g. break to debug
- added display of 'movie length' in TAS mode. This is the length of your
  'movie' if you upload it to tasvideos.org
- added -triplesize to video recorder: allows creation of video files in
  960x720 pixels, for which YouTube renders videos at 60 fps.
- some fixes in keyboard mappings
- fixed slow console when emulation speed is very low
- add a snapshot 'near the end' to the OMR when saving it, allowing quicker
  continuation of the replay after loading it
- similarly, add snapshots when fast-forwarding to the target time, so they
  can be used to jump back more quickly
- show reverse bar in green when replaying in viewonly mode
- added a converter from/to OMR to/from text, which allows you to more easily
  edit the OMR outside of openMSX
- improved implementation of 'auto-save' feature of replays: the setting will
  now persist over openMSX sessions
- added an OSD overlay for Metal Gear

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- replace mingw32 build support with MinGW-w64 build support on Windows
- updated our website and other URL's to point to http://openmsx.org/ or
  GitHub

And of course the usual various bug fixes and performance improvements.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
