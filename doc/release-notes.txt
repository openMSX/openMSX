Release Notes for openMSX 19.0 (2023-07-xx)
===========================================

More bug fixes and smaller improvements. Large improvements on the OSD menu and
the diskmanipulator.

Special thanks to all the contributors of this release who are not in the core
team! Keep these pull requests coming!

Here's the list with all highlights and details:

MSX device support:
- SCC+: clear RAM when powering off/on
- WD2793: fixed bug when writing CRC bytes
- V9990:
  - fixed interlaced screen rendering
  - fixed Bx mode cursor drawing
- R800: fixed behavoiur with double prefix, as it acts like double NOP unlike
  Z80
- Carnivore 2: updated initial (out-of-the-box) flash content, with bootmenu
  2.52
- fixed NinjaTap emulation (at the cost of the PSG pin 6/7 behaviour)
- fixed formatting on Philips VY-0010 disk drives
- implemented (more) I/O port mirroring for S-1985 and S-3527 based machines
  for PSG, VDP, PPI, RTC, printer)
- implemented some weird behaviour of the printer port (implemented unused bits
  specification and status showing on all ports for some machines)
- added mapper for RetroHard MultiCart 31 in 1 cartridges
- added new machines/extensions, thanks to:
  - Peter Hanraets: Sony HB-11 and Sony HB-F701xx
  - alwro07: Polish Spectravideo SVI-738
  - Daniel Padilla: Victor HC-90A (WIP)
  - Takamichi Suzukawa: Nikko PC-70100 (hidden MSX) and Sanyo MPC-10mkII
  - Others: Sunrise IDE with Nextor ROM, Swedish Spectravideo SVI-738, Yamaha
    SKW-01 Word Processor

New or improved emulator features:
- VDP: fixed assertion failure when cmdtiming=broken
- many improvements on machine and extension descriptions
- OSD menu:
  - show machine type and region info in list of machines
  - show current machine in main menu title (as most actions operate on it)
  - show machine and extension information/details whilst selecting them,
    including whether it will work when selected
  - allow user to add/remove IPS patches for ROMs
  - fixed location of selection bar (was too high)
  - scroll menu items that do not fit horizontally to be able to read them
  - for long paths, only show the last part (instead of clipping after the
    first part)
  - minor aesthetic tweaks
  - don't show add/remove dialog for extensions if none are present and show
    the amount inserted in the menu
  - always show menu on top
- disk manipulator (many thanks to Laurens Holst!)
  - fixed import command
  - fixed newline issue in dir command
  - fixed possibly illegal date/time stamps when importing
  - fixed crash when exporting/listing by proper detection of end-of-directory
  - many other/smaller robustness fixes
  - added FAT16 support for dir, chdir, mkdir, import, export, create and
    format
  - both DOS1 and DOS2 bootsectors can be generated
  - added support for Nextor partitions
  - added support for Nextor FAT12 formatting
  - skip hidden directories when exporting
  - improved filtering on unsupported file name characters
  - convert MSX file names to UTF-8 both when reading from and writing to the
    host file system
  - added partition command to partition an existing disk
  - added support for Beer IDE 1.9 partitions
- cassetteplayer 'getpos' command now also works in recording mode
- fixed desyncs in replays when using mouse input
- make it possible for some devices to find out which ROM file they use
- make it possible to query the VDP type in Tcl
- fixed calculation of hash for e.g. hard disk images (unfortunately making it
  slower again)
- fixed SaI3xScaler
- fixed crash when video system cannot be initialized, show an error instead
- fixed crash when using the Dooly mapper with a too small ROM image
- added MIDI input support to ALSA (thanks to Cacodemon345!)
- callback procs can now be persistenty changed to a custom implementation
  (ivalid PSG direcitons, invalid PPI mode, di-halt, generic messages)
- added a way to cancel the type command (with -cancel option)
- added warnings on reads/writes to writeonly/readly registers (thanks to Pedro
  de Medeiros)
- fixed crash when toggling the 'VR' bit in the VDP
- fixed crash when making screenshot with SDL renderer
- added debuggables for VDP register and palette latch status (thanks to Pedro
  de Medeiros)
- expose VRAM write access status to Tcl (thanks to Pedro de Medeiros)
- added YM2151 recording to VGM recorder (thanks to sneep)
- fixed crash when required OpenGL version was not found
- added small delay to fix automatic typing of loading instruction for games
  like Elite
- fixed ar_fr keyboard mapping (ignoring right-to-left characters)

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- fixed compilation on some platforms (missing ctime include)
- required GNU compiler is now at least g++-10. Android build is totally
  broken, as its libc++ is missing a lot of things. Will probably be better
  with NDK 26.
- update build process for macOS, automatically sign code when Apple Developers
  ID is available
- 3rd party updates of SDL (2.26.4), Tcl (8.6.13) and libpng (1.6.39)
- added patch to add aarch64 support to libtheora 3rdparty build


And of course the usual various bug fixes and performance improvements.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
