EX (SP),HL
==========

This instruction does 5 memory transactions

 - 1 byte instruction fetch
 - 2 bytes data reads
 - 2 bytes data writes

The goal of this test is to find out the order of these 5 transactions.
Obviously the instruction fetch (F) is the first transaction.

There is one read from location SP+0, I'll call this R0. One read from
location SP+1 (R0). A write to SP+0 (W0) and a write to SP+1 (W1).

R0 must come before WO and R1 must come before W1. This leaves the
following possible orders (please check that I didn't miss some):

  a) F R0 W0 R1 W1
  b) F R0 R1 W0 W1
  c) F R0 R1 W1 W0
  d) F R1 W1 R0 W0
  e) F R1 R0 W1 W0
  f) F R1 R0 W0 W1


* Z80

In the document z80cpu_um.pdf you can find the number of cycles per M-cycle.
For the EX (SP),HL instruction it lists:

  5 M-cycles, 19 T-states, 4+3+4+3+5

  note: this doesn't include the extra wait-state introduced on MSX.

This can be explained like this (note, I'm guessing here, but it seems
to fit well on the number of T-states).

  M1:  fetch/decode opcode              4     cycles
  M2:  tmpL = read(SP)                  3     cycles
  M3:  ++SP ; tmpH = read(SP)           1+3   cycles
  M4:  write(SP, H)                     3     cycles
  M5:  --SP ; write(SP, L) ; HL = tmp   1+3+1 cycles

  fetching opcode (or prefix) takes 4 cycles in all Z80 instructions
  reading/writing memory takes 3 cycles on Z80

This corresponds with order c) [F R0 R1 W1 W0]


* R800

On R800, the instruction takes 7 cycles if SP+0 and SP+1 are in the same
256-byte page, 9 cycles if not (see r800test.txt for more details on this).
So it seems there are two extra page-breaks in the latter case, order a)
and d) need only 1 extra page-break (of course it's not impossible there
still are 2 page-breaks, or one page-break and some other extra cost).
In any case the timing doesn't give us enough information.

We need another test to be sure about the order. We'll do this by setting
the stack pointer to a memory-mapped IO region:

In the MSXTurboR, in slot 3-3, there's a ROM mapper. Writes to the region
0x6C00-0x6FFF will switch the ROM in region 0x6000-0x7FFF. The content
of the ROM is like this:

  page 0, address 0x6C80/0x6C81: F6 50
       1                         C3 3E
       2                         08 07

Now execute the following program, with slot 3-3 selected in page 1
(0x4000-0x7FFF).

-------------------------------

	org	#C000

	di
	ld	(save),sp
	ld	sp,#6C80

	xor	a
	ld	(#6C80),a

	ld	hl,#0201
	ex	(sp),hl
	ld	de,(#6C80)

	ld	sp,(save)
	ret

save	dw	0

------------------------------

After running this program the registers HL/DE contain these values

  HL = 50F6
  DE = 3EC3

Register DE contains the ROM content after both writes (W0,W1) are done.
The value of DE comes from ROM page 1, so writing of L=1 (=W0) must come
after writing of H=2 (=W1).

Both register H and L contain the content of the initial ROM page
(page 0), this means both reads are executed before either of the writes.

This leaves two possibilities:
  
  c) F R0 R1 W1 W0     [FRrww] [FRRwW]
  e) F R1 R0 W1 W0     [FRrww] [FRRWW]

I've also indicated the page-breaks when SP+0 and SP+1 are in the same or
in a different page (again see r800test.txt for details). Possibility e)
would require 10 cycles, possibility c) matches the measurement of 9
cycles.


* conclusion

Both Z80 and R800 use the same order [F R0 R1 W1 W0]. The result on R800
is based on measurements, for Z80 it's based on extrapolating T-state
documentation. It would be nice to also actually measure it on Z80.


The order [F R0 WO R1 W1] would have been better on R800: it would only
require 8 cycles in case of a SP+0 SP+1 page break. Though that would be
incompatible with Z80. Also most of the time it doesn't matter because
the top-stack-word doesn't cross a page boundary too often (even never
when the stack is two-bytes aligned).
