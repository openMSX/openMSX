COMMANDS
========


after
-----

  Execute a command after a certain time, or after a certain time of being
  idle. It is possible the query a list of postponed commands and also to
  cancel postponed commands.

  usage:
    after time <seconds> <command>  execute a command after some time
    after idle <seconds> <command>  execute a command after some time being idle
    after frame <command>           execute a command after a new frame is drawn
    after break <command>           execute a command after a breakpoint is
                                    reached

bind / unbind / bind_default / unbind_default
---------------------------------------------
  
  Associate key presses with commands. Whenever you press one of the programmed
  keys, the corresponding command will be executed.
  To customize your keybindings you should use the (un)bind commands. A script
  that wants to provide a default binding for its functionality needs to use
  bind_default. 
  
  usage:
    bind                    shows all bindings
    bind   <key>            shows binding for this key
    bind   <key> <command>  make a new binding
    unbind <key>            undo binding for this key
  
  examples:
    bind PAGEUP "set speed 100"
    bind PAGEDOWN "set speed 50"
    unbind F9
    bind F9 "set throttle off"
    bind F9,release "set throttle on"

    incr renshaturbo 10


quit
----

  Quits the emulator.
  
  The native TCL command is called "exit".


restoredefault
--------------

  Restore the default value for a setting.

  This command is deprecated, better use "unset <setting>".

SETTINGS
========


accuracy
--------

  Sets the render accuracy. Currently there are three render modes:
    - screen accurate: This is the fastest but also least accurate mode.
    - line accurate: This is the recommended mode. Most tricks are 
                     rendered correctly.
    - pixel accurate: This is the slowest but also most accurate mode.
                      In this mode even the 'Unknown Reality scope part'
                      is rendered correctly.
  Note: not all renderers support all render modes

  usage:

---------

  Controls VDP command execution timing.
  [ mainly useful for debugging purposes ]
  

color_matrix
------------

  This setting represents a 3x3 matrix that is used to transform MSX RGB colors
  to host RGB colors. This setting can be used to generate all kind of color
  schemes, see scripts/monitor.tcl for examples.

        | . . . |   | Rm |   | Rh |
        | . . . | x | Gm | = | Gh |
        | . . . |   | Bm |   | Bh |

    set color_matrix
      --> shows the current value
    set color_matrix { { 1 0 0 } { 0 1 0 } { 0 0 1 } }
      --> this is the deafult (no color transformation)
    set color_matrix { { .33 .33 .33 } { .33 .33 .33 } { .33 .33 .33 } }
      --> transform to greyscale

    set console off   turns the console off
    

consolebackground
------------------

  Change the console background image. Most image formats (.png, .jpeg,
  .gif, ...) are supported. Some renderers (openGL) can use an alpha
  channel, this channel is only present in .png images.

  usage:
    set consolebackground          shows the current setting
    set consolebackground <image>  sets a new background


consolecolumns

  usage:
    set consolecolumns             shows the current setting
    set consolecolumns <value>	   set the specified width


consolefont
-----------

  Change the console font. Most image formats (.png, .jpeg, .gif, ...)
  are supported. The image must contain a 16x16 matrix with the characters
  in ASCII order. Some renderers (openGL) require an alpha channel to have
  transparency in the font, this channel is only present in .png images.

  usage:
    set consolefont          shows the current setting
    set consolefont <image>  sets a new font

  Turns deinterlacing on/off.
  Note: not all renderers support deinterlacing.

  usage:
    set deinterlace      shows the current setting
    set deinterlace on   turns deinterlacing on
    set deinterlace off  turns deinterlacing off


frequency
---------

  The sound mixer frequency. Changing this setting only takes effect the next
  time openMSX is started.

  usage:
    set frequency        shows the current setting 
    set frequency 44100  use 44.1kHz mixing frequency


firmwareswitch
-----------

  Some machines (e.g. TurboR) have a switch on the front (or on the back) that
  controls if the machine should boot 'normally' or start the built in
  software, also called firmware. This setting controls the position of that
  switch.

  usage:
    set firmwareswitch      shows the current setting
    set firmwareswitch on   in this position the internal software is started
    set firmwareswitch off  in this position the machine boots 'normally'


fullscreen
----------

  Switch to / back from fullscreen mode.

  usage:
    set fullscreen      shows the current setting
    set fullscreen on   switch to fullscreen mode
    set fullscreen off  switch to normal mode


fullspeedwhenloading
--------------------

  When enabled, openMSX will try to detect when it is loading from diskette or
  cassette and in case it is, it will run at full speed (taking all CPU power
  it can get). This can be convenient if you're not interested in the realistic
  loading times on MSX. Default is off, because it is not according to the
  behaviour of a real MSX.

  usage:
    set fullspeedwhenloading      shows the current setting
    set fullspeedwhenloading on   enable the full speed when loading feature
    set fullspeedwhenloading off  disable the feature


gamma
-----

  usage:
    set gamma        shows the current value
    set gamma <num>  set new value

    
glow
----
  
  Sets the amount of glow effect.
  Note: not all renderers support this.

  usage:
    set glow          shows the current setting
    set glow <value>  change the value


grabinput
---------

  Controls whether openMSX grabs all input or not. When this setting is turned
  on, all input is directly passed to openMSX. The mouse pointer can't leave
  the openMSX window and the window manager won't be able to react to keyboard
  shortcuts.

  usage:
    set grabinput      shows the current setting
    set grabinput on   turn input grabbing mode on
    set grabinput off  turn input grabbing mode off


icon.<name>.xcoord
icon.<name>.ycoord
icon.<name>.active.image
icon.<name>.non-active.image
icon.<name>.active.fade-delay
icon.<name>.active.fade-duration
icon.<name>.non-active.fade-delay
icon.<name>.non-active.fade-duration
------------------------------------

  Controls the appearance of the OSD LED icons.
  
  <name> can be 'caps', 'fdd', 'kana', 'pause', 'power' or 'turbo'.

  The position is set with the 'xcoord' and 'ycoord' settings. The active and
  non-active version have the same position. The value is in pixels and (0,0)
  corresponds to the top-left of the screen.
  Note: In the future this will most likely change so that it is resolution
        independent (scale_factor setting)

  The image for the LED can be specified with the '(non-)active.image' setting.
  This can be an image of any size and the image can have an alpha
  (=transparency) channel. Typically this will be .png files.

  Fade duration and delay control how (and if) the icon will fade away. When
  the LED changes status (on->off or off->on) the image is always shown, after
  the 'delay' time it will start to fade out. The time from completely visible
  to completely transparent is controlled with the fade.duration setting. Both
  fade.duration and fade.delay are specified in milliseconds. A fade delay of 0
  means don't fade out. Duration and delay can be set independently for active
  and non-active image.

  usage:
    set icon.fdd.xcoord 250
    set icon.fdd.ycoord 0
    set icon.fdd.active.image fdd-on.png
    set icon.fdd.active.image fdd-off.png
    set icon.fdd.active.fade-delay 0             don't fade out active fdd LED
    set icon.fdd.active.fade-duration 5000
    set icon.fdd.non-active.fade-delay 5000
    set icon.fdd.non-active.fade-duration 5000
    

inputdelay
----------

  [ Only Change this if you understand what this setting does]

  Input events for the MSX machine are delayed by this amount. Increase this
  value when the MSX machine misses keyboard presses when you type very fast.
  Decrease this value to reduce the latency between pressing a key on the host
  machine and seeing it being typed in the MSX machine.
  
  Note: the default value (3/100s) should almost always be OK, this small delay
        is practically not noticeable and still allows the MSX machine to get
        accurate timing on the input events.


keyjoystick<n>.<button>
-----------------------

  <n>        1, 2
  <button>   up, down, left, right, triga, trigb

  Configure the keys of the keyjoysticks. It's likely this will change in the
  future.

  usage:
    set keyjoystick1.up W
    set keyjoystick1.down S
    set keyjoystick1.left A
    set keyjoystick1.right D
    set keyjoystick1.triga SPACE


limitsprites
------------

  reduce sprite flashing. Note that some games make use of this limitation.

  usage:
    set limitsprites
    set limitsprites on   limit number of sprites per line
    set limitsprites off  no limit on number of sprites per line


machine
-------

    set rs232-outputfilename myrs232output.txt  write to myrs232output.txt


samples
-------

  Sets the size of the sound mixer buffer. Changing this setting only takes
  effect the next time openMSX is started.

  usage:
    set samples       shows the current setting 
    set samples 1024  use mixing buffer of 1024 samples


save_settings_on_exit
---------------------

  Automatically save the current settings when openMSX exits (execute a
  save_settings command).

  usage:
    set save_settings_on_exit        Show current setting
    set save_settings_on_exit true   Enable auto save
    set save_settings_on_exit false  Disable auto save
    

scale_algorithm
---------------
  
  Select the algorithm used to transform MSX pixels to host pixels.
  
  usage:
    set scale_algorithm         Show current setting
    set scale_algorithm simple  Select the default scale algorithm
    set scale_algorithm hq      Select the hq scale algorithm


scale_factor
------------

  Select the scale factor. Scale factor 'n' means the typical MSX pixel
  (MSX resolution 256x212) is mapped on 'n' host pixels. For the moment
  the possible values are 1, 2 or 3. In the future we may support a wider
  range or even non integer values.

  usage:
    set scale_factor       Show current setting
    set scale_factor <n>   Set a new scale factor


scanline
--------

  Sets the amount of scanline effect.
  Note: not all renderers support this.

  usage:
    set scanline          shows the current setting
    set scanline <value>  change the value


sound_driver
------------

  Select the sound output driver. The list of available sound drivers is
  platform specific.

  usage:
    set sound_driver sdl

speed
-----

  Sets the emulation speed relative to the speed of a real MSX. Speed 100 means
  as fast as a real MSX.

  usage:
    set speed        shows current emulation speed
    set speed <num>  set new emulation speed


[soundchip]_mode
------------------

  Sets the channel mode for individual sound chips. Note that chips which are in
  stereo mode cannot be set to another mode and chips that are not in stereo
  mode, can of course never be set to stereo mode.

  usage:
    set [soundchip]_mode        shows the current setting
    set [soundchip]_mode <mode> set new mode

  examples:
    set PSG_mode
    set PSG_mode left
    set "FMPAC_mode" mono


[soundchip]_volume
------------------

  Sets the volume for individual sound chips.

  usage:
    set [soundchip]_volume        shows the current setting
    set [soundchip]_volume <num>  set new volume

  examples:
    set PSG_volume
    set PSG_volume 18000
    set "FMPAC_volume" 15000


throttle
--------

  Sets throttle mode. In throttle mode the emulator tries to run at the
  specified speed (see speed command). When throttling is turned off the
  emulator runs as fast as possible.

  usage:
    set throttle      shows the current setting
    set throttle on   turn throttle mode on
    set throttle off  turn throttle mode off
    

user_directories
----------------

  The list of "user directories". This makes it a bit more convenient to
  insert disks, tapes, roms, ... See manual for more details.
  This setting is a list in TCL format (items are space separated or enclosed
  in braces, see TCL manual for details). Thus all TCL functions to manipulate
  lists can be used on this setting.

  usage:
    set user_directories                   Shows the current list
    set user_directories "~/disks ~/roms"  Replace the list with a new one
    set user_directories {}                Remove all user directories
    lappend user_directories ~/tapes       Add a directory to the list


vdpcmdtrace
-----------

  Enable/disable VDP command tracing.
  [ mainly useful for debugging purposes ]


z80_freq and z80_freq_locked
----------------------------

  These two settings control the Z80 clock frequency. When z80_freq_locked is
  true the emulated Z80 runs at the normal 3.5MHz (or optionally 5.3MHz on some
  machines). When z80_freq_locked is false the value of z80_freq is taken as
  Z80 clock frequency.

  usage:
    set z80_freq 14318180
    set z80_freq_locked false
       overclock Z80 to 14MHz
       
    set Z80_freq 7159090
    bind F8 "toggle z80_freq_locked"
       F8 now switches between 3.5MHz and 7MHz
