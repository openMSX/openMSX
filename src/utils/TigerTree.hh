/** Incremental Tiger-tree-hash (tth) calculation.
 *
 * This code is based on code from the tigertree project
 *    https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigertree/
 *
 * The main difference is that the original code can only perform a one-shot
 * tth calculation while this code (also) allows incremental tth calculations.
 * When the input data changes, incremental calculation allows to only redo
 * part of the full calculation, so it can be much faster.
 *
 * Here's the copyright notice of the original code (even though the code is
 * almost completely rewritten):
