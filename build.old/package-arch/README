PKGBUILD file for building an openMSX package for archlinux/i686, contributed
by Theo Smit <mappy@dutchlinuxclan.nl>.

This PKGBUILD was only tested on i686 (32-bit), if you want to build for an
x86_64 machine you can try to modify the PKGBUILD accordingly. If you're lucky
you only have to modify the "arch=" line.

Usage:
- Create a temporary working directory and go there:
    $ mkdir /tmp/build-openmsx
    $ cd /tmp/build-openmsx
- Copy the PKGBUILD file there:
    $ cp path/to/PKGBUILD .
- Run the "makepkg" tool:
    $ makepkg
  This will download the sources for openMSX 0.6.2, verify the dependencies,
  compile openMSX, install it in the temporary directory and archive that
  installation into a binary openMSX package.
- Install the binary package with the standard Arch package manager:
    $ pacman -A openmsx-0.6.2-1-i686.pkg.tar.gz
- Now you can start openMSX:
    $ /opt/openMSX/bin/openmsx

Please read the documentation in /opt/openMSX/doc/manual to learn more about
openMSX, for example how to install additional system ROMs.
