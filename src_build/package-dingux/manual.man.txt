[Key Bindings]

The D-pad and the A and B buttons are mapped as MSX joystick 1. The X button presses the MSX shift key, the Y button presses the MSX space bar.

The Select button opens/closes the OSD keyboard, while the Start button opens/closes the OSD menu. The OSD menu can also be opened/closed by flicking the power slider into its upward position. Putting the power slider in its hold (downward) position pauses the emulated MSX.

Finally, the shoulder buttons can be used to adjust the master volume of the MSX.

[System ROMs]

openMSX comes with the C-BIOS system ROMs, which is an open source MSX BIOS. If you'd like to use other system ROMs, for example to get disk support or because you want to emulate the exact MSX model you had years ago, you have to install those yourself.

Run openMSX once and it will create the directory structure. Then via (S)FTP or Dingux Commander you can put the system ROM files in the ".openMSX/share/systemroms" directory, which is located in your home directory. Make sure you enable the displaying of hidden directories or you won't see ".openMSX" listed. The names of the system ROM files don't matter: openMSX will detect them by checksum.
