<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
In the <code>Documentation</code> directory you can find the documentation for openMSX. Some sections you might want to read first:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="Documentation/manual/user.html#keymapping">Key Mapping</a></dt>
<dd>Lists which keys you need to press for special MSX key and for emulator functions.</dd>
<dt><a href="Documentation/manual/setup.html#systemroms">System ROMs</a></dt>
<dd>Describes how openMSX deals with system ROMs. This binary distribution has C-BIOS inside of it. Should you decide to install additional system ROMs, I suggest you put them in <code>~/.openMSX/share/systemroms</code>. That way, if you upgrade openMSX later, they will automatically be found by the new version.</dd>
<dt><a href="Documentation/release-history.txt">Release History</a></dt>
<dd>Lists the changes made in each release of openMSX. Read this to learn about new features or changed behaviour.</dd>
<dt><a href="Documentation/authors.txt">Authors</a> and <a href="Documentation/GPL.txt">License</a></dt>
<dd>Tells you about the people who made openMSX and the conditions for distributing it.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Running MSX Software</h2>
<dl>
<dt>ROM files (ROM images)</dt>
<dd>Open the OSD (On-Screen Display) menu using Cmd+O, then choose "Load ROM...".</dd>
<dt>DSK files (disk images)</dt>
<dd>Open the OSD menu using Cmd+O, then choose "Insert Disk...". Make sure you select a machine that supports disks; C-BIOS does not yet have disk support. If you installed system ROMs (see above), you can change the MSX model that is emulated in the OSD menu under "Hardware... &gt; Change Machine...".</dd>
<dt>CAS files (cassette images)</dt>
<dd>Open the OSD menu using Cmd+O, then choose "Set Tape...". As for disks, you will need to select a machine that supports cassettes; C-BIOS does not yet support cassettes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Double clicking a file in the Finder to open it in openMSX unfortunately doesn't always work; this might be fixed in future openMSX versions.
</p>
<p>
To shorten the loading times of disks and cassettes, you can type <code>set fullspeedwhenloading on</code> on the openMSX console, which can be opened with Cmd+L.
